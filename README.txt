Demo Project to Blockchain Simulator
I am using this project as a demonstration in my Graduate Software Design course at Drexel University (SE575).
Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the “Blockchain Simulator”. I used Node.js for this project. I used Express.js framework. I used JavaScript as the frontend.  The demo of this video will be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdofx9OhmHk&feature=youtu.be
Instructions
Because these are node projects, after cloning this repo you will need to run the following
>> npm install
>> npm install express
 The run command for this project is:
		>>npm start
